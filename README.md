# OCI Basic Network Terraform Demo
This Terraform code deploys a networking scheme in OCI to manage basic deployments. It consists of two subnets, which are divided into the following categories.

- *SUBNET_PUBLIC:* This network is for public purposes, in case it is necessary to deploy a resource that can be used from any point (for example, a VPN).
- *SUBNET_PRIVATE:* This network is for private purposes, in case it is necessary to deploy a resource that can be used internally (for example, a database).
